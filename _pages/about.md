I am an Associate Professor at the Delft University of Technology, where I am affiliated with the Data Intensive Systems Section of the Department of Software Technology.

I am a Senior Member of IEEE and the principal investigator of a <a href='https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/212158'> Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) project </a> aimed at building scalable graph ML solutions for financial crime analysis. 
My research interests include graph algorithms, graph neural networks, parallel computing, hardware acceleration, and their applications to real-world problems.

Before joining TU Delft in January 2024, I was a Senior Research Scientist at <a href='https://research.ibm.com/labs/zurich'> IBM Research -- Zurich </a>, where I spent 15 years. 
Notably, I led a global IBM Research Challenge on scalable and automated graph machine learning from 2021 to 2023. 
This effort led to new AI-powered real-time transaction monitoring capabilities in IBM's mainframe software solutions (specifically, in the AI Toolkit for IBM Z and LinuxOne) 
as well as an IBM Outstanding Technical Accomplishment Award in December 2023.

While with IBM Research -- Zurich, I also taught postgraduate courses at the University of Tübingen and at the Sabanci University, Istanbul. 
Furthermore, I served in the technical program committees or organizing committees of more than 50 scientific conferences and co-chaired two (IEEE ASAP 2013 and IEEE ASAP 2014 conferences). 

Before joining IBM Research -- Zurich, I was with the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (2002--2003), Bogazici University Istanbul (2003--2005), and Imperial College London (2005--2008), where I worked on design automation of application-specific microprocessors, and obtained two best paper awards for this work (at the DAC 2003 and at the IEEE ASAP 2008 conferences).
